given an array of n integers
return maximum of two numbers whose add up to an equal sum
example: given a = [51,71,17,42]
would return 93, the max possible sum in all the sums here
the sum cannot be unique
to get this maximum sum there needs to be at least two pairs of digits that add 
up to maximum sum

naive approach
for digit in array
	for next digit in array
		calculate sum and add it to array
		
optimized approach
maybe recursion?
base case: array has a length < 2
general case: you would have a foor loop
take the first element of the array, get all combinations of sums, insert maximum sum of first elemtn back into array
increment
