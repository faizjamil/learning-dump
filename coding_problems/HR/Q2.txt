question 2

highest positive gap between two elements
example: [7,1,2,5]
at first element, we do nothing since there is no previous element to compare to

second element is less than the first, not greater
third element is greater than second, difference is one
fourth element is greater than 2nd element, difference is four'
fourth element is greater than 3rd element, difference is three
max difference is four

# naive algorithm is as follows
# pointer_one = 0
# pointer_two = 1
# max_difference = 0
# time complexity seems to be O(n^2)
# while (pointer_one is before the 2nd to last element of array):
#     
#     if element at pointer two is less than element at pointer one, we continue with loop
#         pointer_one += 1
#         pointer_two = pointer_one + 1
#     elif element at pointer two is greater than element at pointer one
#         max_difference = max value between max_difference and (element at pointer two) - (element at pointer one)
#		  if pointer_two is at end of array, increment pointer_one and set pointer_two to pointer_one+1
# test with px = [2,3,10,2,4,8,1]
# trace:
# pointer_one    pointer_two    max_difference
# 0				 1				0
# 0				 2				1
# 0				 3				8
# 0 			 4				8
# 0              5              8
# 0    			 6				8
# 1				 2				8
# 1				 3				8
# 2				 3				8
# 3				 4				8
# 4				 5				8
# 4				 6				8
# 5				 6				8
